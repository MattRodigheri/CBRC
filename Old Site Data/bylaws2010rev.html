			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>I. Name and affiliation</B></P>
			<P><B>A. Name.</B> The official name of this organization shall be the “Western Field Ornithologists’ California
			Bird Records Committee,” which may be shortened to the “California Bird Records Committee” and is hereafter referred
			to as “the Committee.”</P>
			<P><B>B. Affiliation</B>. This is a committee of the Organization known as the “Western Field Ornithologists.”</P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>II. Purposes</B></P>
			<P>A. Endorse records of selected birds from the State of California and adjacent ocean, including, but not limited
			to, all such records submitted for publication to any official journal or checklist of the Western Field Ornithologists.
			“Adjacent Ocean” is herein defined as that area within the United States Fisheries Conservation Zone, which lies
			south of 42<FONT FACE="Symbol">&deg;</FONT>N latitude (a line drawn west from the Oregon border). This area is
			within 200 nautical miles of the nearest point of land in California, except to the extent the southern boundary
			is truncated by areas under the jurisdiction of Mexico pursuant to international law.</P>

			<P>B. Permanently maintain or cause to be maintained the original bird records and all Committee votes and comments
			for use by future bird students.</P>
			<P>C. Publish at least minimal data on all records receiving a decision.</P>
			<P>D. Provide a means by which sight records can gain universal acceptance as valuable scientific data.</P>
			<P>E. Increase knowledge of the birds of California.</P>
			<P>F. Establish standards of observation and reporting against which field observers may compare their own techniques.</P>
			<P>G. Keep, or cause to be kept, the official California State Bird List.</P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>III. Membership</B></P>
			<P><B>A. Number and Definitions</B>. The Committee shall consist of at least nine Voting Members, one of whom is
			the “Chair,” and one of whom is the “Vice-Chair,” each with one vote.</P>
			<P><B>B. Qualifications.</B> Anyone is eligible to become a Voting Member if, in the estimation of the existing
			Voting Members, that person has demonstrated an expert ability in, and knowledge of, field identification of birds
			and is a member in good standing of Western Field Ornithologists.</P>
			<P><B>C. Members.</B></P>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>
				<P><B>(1) Election and Term of Office.</B></P>
				<BLOCKQUOTE>
					<P>(a) Voting Members shall be elected on a staggered basis, each for a term of three years, so that three will
					be elected each year. Election shall be by vote of a quorum present in person or represented by written absentee
					ballot at the Annual Meeting of the Committee; proxies shall not be used in this election, but an absent Voting
					Member may vote by indicating the choices to the Chair in writing prior to the meeting. The three candidates receiving
					the largest number of votes shall be elected; if necessary, ties shall be decided by additional ballots listing
					only those persons tied.</P>
					<P>(b) Voting Members take office at the close of the Annual Meeting at which they were elected and serve until
					the close of the third Annual Meeting after election, or until their successors take office. The Members-Elect
					may, at the discretion of the existing Committee, be seated, without vote, during the remainder of the Annual Meeting
					at which they were elected.</P>
					<P>(c) Voting Members may serve only one full term, after which they must retire until the next annual meeting
					before they may be considered for reelection.</P>
				</BLOCKQUOTE>
				<P><B>(2) Nominations.</B> Nominations of Voting Members shall be made only by Voting Members and only in writing
				to the Chair at least 30 days prior to the Annual Meeting. It is the responsibility of the nominator to obtain
				confirmation of willingness to serve from the nominees submitted. A nominator may make a maximum of one nomination
				per each vacancy. If the total number of nominees is not sufficient to fill the vacant seats, it is the responsibility
				of the Chair to nominate the number of persons required. The Chair shall transmit the names of the nominees to

			</UL>
			<P><B>G. Removals.</B> The Committee may remove, for cause, the Secretary, or any Voting Members who are delinquent
			in their duties. Such action requires a vote of the majority of all other Voting Members, not merely of a quorum.

			ballot to the Committee. If removal of the chair is proposed, the Vice-Chair shall preside.</P>
			<P><B>H. Vacancies and Special Elections.</B> If the Committee loses a Voting Member during mid-term (through death,
			resignation, removal, or otherwise), the Chair shall immediately conduct an election, termed a Special Election,
			for the purpose of filling the vacancy. A Special Election may be conducted at a meeting or by individual contact

			<P><B>A. Annual Meeting.</B> An Annual Meeting of the Committee shall be held once a year, at a time and place
			set by the Chair, in consultation with the Members and Secretary, for the purpose of election and for transacting
			such other business as may be brought before the meeting. The Chair must give to all Members prior notice of the
			Annual Meeting. An agenda and list of nominees for Member shall be provided at least three weeks prior to the Annual
			Meeting.</P>
			<P><B>B. Special Meetings.</B> Special Meetings of the Committee may be called by the Chair, or by agreement of
			five or more Members, or in the Chair’s absence by the Vice-Chair. Whoever calls the meeting must notify and provide
			an agenda to each Voting Member prior to the meeting.</P>
			<P><B>C. Quorum.</B> Five Voting Members in good standing, present in person, not by proxy, shall constitute a
			quorum for any meeting of the Committee.</P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>V. Bylaws</B></P>
			<P><B>A. Formation. </B>All Bylaws and other procedures of the Committee are to be as determined by and only by
			the Committee, except that they may not be inconsistent with the Bylaws of the Western Field Ornithologists, or
			with rules adopted by its Board of Directors, or be prohibited by law.</P>
			<P><B>B. Review.</B> The Bylaws shall be reviewed regularly, at least once every five years, by the Committee.</P>
			<P><B>C. Amendments.</B> These Bylaws may be amended by an affirmative vote of all or all but one of a quorum at
			any Committee meeting.</P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>VI. Bird Records</B></P>
			<P><B>A. Definitions.</B> For the purposes of this Committee and these Bylaws, a “record” is considered to be documentation
			submitted to the Committee as proof of the identity and presence of a bird. The “Review List” is that most recent
			list of “forms” (such as species, superspecies, subspecies or hybrid combinations) that will be accepted for review
			by the Committee.</P>
			<P><B>B. Records Treated.</B></P>
			<UL>
				<P>(1) Records only from the State of California and adjacent ocean (as defined in II.A.) will be treated.</P>
				<P>(2) The forms treated will be determined from time to time by the Committee. In general, the Review List will
				consist of species that have occurred within California and adjacent ocean on an average of four or fewer times
				per year during the ten-year period immediately preceding revision of the Review List. By vote of at least seven
				members at a meeting or by other voting procedure, the Committee may, as it sees fit, add other species (such as
				those whose identification is difficult) or forms (such as superspecies, subspecies, or hybrid combinations) to
				the Review List. To add or delete a form to/from the Review List shall require at least seven votes. Records of
				species not on the Review List, but for which there is no accepted record for California, will be treated.</P>
				<P>(3) The criteria for inclusion on the Review List, and the forms listed, will be reviewed at least once every
				five years.</P>
				<P>(4) Records based on specimens or bandings will be treated in the same manner as other records.</P>
				<P>(5) Any record, whether published or not, old or new, may be submitted by a Voting Member or other person. An
				exception to this is a record that has received a previous Committee decision (see Resubmission).</P>
				<P>(6) Records concerning forms that are only locally or temporally rare in California will not be treated.</P>
				<P>(7) Without specific Committee approval (i.e., approval of all or all but one Members at a meeting), forms other
				than species will not be treated unless listed on the Review List.</P>
				<P>(8) The Committee will also review records of breeding populations of introduced species not on the state list,
				but only if evidence is submitted that attempts to prove (a) the correct identification of the species and (b)
				the viability of the population. To be judged viable, a population must: (i) have bred in the state for fifteen
				(15) consecutive years, (ii) in general, be increasing or stabilized after an initial period of increase, (iii)
				be judged to have occupied all geographically contiguous suitable habitat to such a degree as to sustain the population
				and be thought unlikely to significantly diminish, and (iv) occupy an environment judged similar enough in ecological
				factors (e.g., climate, vegetation, food, shelter, competitors, predators) to the species’ natural habitat, or
				to other successful introductions, that permanent establishment seems likely.</P>
			</UL>
			<P><B>C. Submission.</B> Records may be submitted in any form, including on the Committee’s official Report Form.</P>
			<P><B>D. Resubmission.</B></P>
			<UL>
				<P>(1) A record that has received a final Committee decision, even though published in a Committee Annual Report,
				may be resubmitted by the Chair, a Member, an observer, or any other person. For previously accepted records, any
				member may bring the record to an annual meeting and request that it be re-reviewed. A simple majority vote is
				then required to re-review the record. Previously not accepted records continue to require new and substantial
				documentary evidence that might affect the decision, as judged by a majority of those voting at an annual meeting.
				For a record not accepted because of questionable natural occurrence, such evidence might include the recognition
				of a natural pattern of occurrence. Such a record must be resubmitted and circulated as if never before submitted,
				except that it should be accompanied by all previous votes and comments of the Committee, its publication status,
				and all new evidence marked as such.</P>
				<P>(2) Records previously receiving a final “not accepted” decision must receive all or all but one “accept” votes
				to reverse a record not accepted on identification or establishment of population, or all but two “accept” votes
				to reverse a record not accepted on natural occurrence grounds, with the exception that two “not accept” votes
				based on identification will always result in a decision of “not accepted, identification not established.” Records
				previously receiving a final accepted decision must receive a majority of “not accepted” votes to reverse the previous
				decision and become not accepted; otherwise they remain accepted. Any such re-review of records with previous decisions
				should be discussed in an appropriate annual report.</P>
				<P STYLE="Background-Color : yellow">(3) Accepted records of individual birds returning or continuing through subsequent
				years shall be treated the same as any other resubmission of an accepted record. A majority vote determines whether
				a record is to be treated as a resubmission of a returning or continuing bird.</P>
			</UL>
			<P><B>E. Retraction.</B> A record submitted to the Committee by the observer(s) involved may not be retracted after
			circulation has begun. The observer(s) may submit opinions or additional data that totally or partially negate
			the record. Such new information shall be treated as “new and substantial documentary evidence” (see VI. D.) and
			the record shall have its first submission terminated at the end of the then current circulation and be resubmitted
			under the same record number, except that if the record has already received a final “not accepted” vote, no further
			circulation need take place.</P>
			<P><B>F. Circulation Procedures.</B></P>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>
				<P><B>(1) Initial Receipt by Secretary.</B> Upon receipt of a record, the Secretary should do the following:</P>
			</BLOCKQUOTE>
			<UL>
				<UL>
					<P>(a) Affix to it a unique number, consisting of the year of receipt (not the year of sighting) separated by a
					hyphen from the next available unused number, (starting with “001,” for that year). Each description received in
					support of the same record shall receive the same number.</P>
					<P>(b) Record in a safe place at least the name of the reporter, the species of the bird, the date and locality
					of the record, and the record’s number.</P>
					<P>(c) Check the description for completeness and clarity and, if deemed desirable, request additional information
					from the reporter or other observers. Details thus acquired must be clearly marked as such and kept separate from
					the original submission; the original submission should not be returned to the reporter except in copy form.</P>
					<P>(d) Vote on the record (see Voting), if the Secretary is a Voting Member.</P>
					<P>(e) Send the record with all pertinent supporting documentation (along with other records, if desired) to the
					Chair along with a cover sheet, which must list, in order of circulation, the names and addresses of all Voting
					Members, with the Secretary listed last, as well as the number of the record(s) included in the package.</P>
				</UL>
			</UL>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>
				<P><B>(2) Receipt by Member.</B> Upon receipt of a record, the Member should do the following:</P>
			</BLOCKQUOTE>
			<UL>
				<UL>
					<P>(a) Judge its validity and vote.</P>
					<P>(b) Send the record to the next Member as soon as possible.</P>
					<P>(c) Send the completed Voting Form to the Secretary.</P>
					<P>(d) The last Member to vote should return the record to the Secretary.</P>
					<P>(e) Members anticipating lengthy absences from their mailing address shall report their intentions to the Secretary,
					Chair, and other members; circulation should be rerouted to accommodate such absences.</P>
				</UL>
			</UL>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>
				<P><B>(3) Recirculation.</B></P>
			</BLOCKQUOTE>
			<UL>
				<UL>
					<P>(a) A record shall be recirculated automatically, together with the votes and comments of every Member from
					previous circulations, until it has received a decision vote, until three circulations (two recirculations) have
					been completed, or until it is resubmitted, whichever comes first.</P>
					<P>(b) If after the third circulation the record has not received a decision vote, it will be kept by the Secretary
					until it can be discussed at a meeting of the Committee.</P>
					<P>(c) A record that has not received a final decision after three circulations shall be discussed at a meeting
					of the Committee. No final decision shall be made at the meeting. Instead, the record shall receive a final vote
					(see VI.G.(11)) during a fourth and final circulation to those Voting Members on the Committee at the start of
					said meeting.</P>
					<P>(d) A record that has received a “final” decision during its first circulation (but not during subsequent circulations)
					shall nevertheless be recirculated upon request of any Voting Member or if the Secretary or Chair feels that the
					Committee’s first-circulation comments might alter the decision.</P>
					<P>(e) A record that has received a “final” decision during its regular three circulations shall nevertheless be
					brought to a Committee meeting upon request of any Voting Member within one month of the Secretary announcing the
					decision and shall be discussed. Records that are approved unanimously shall not be subject to this provision and
					shall become final upon the tabulation of the votes by the Secretary.</P>
					<P>(f) Except as noted above, all decisions are final unless a record is to be resubmitted.</P>
				</UL>
			</UL>
			<P><B>G. Voting.</B></P>
			<UL>
				<P><B>(1) Voting Forms.</B> The vote of each Voting Member, together with comments, if any, must be submitted on
				an official Voting Form or reasonable facsimile thereof. This form must include spaces for at least the (a) record
				number, (b) name of the species, (c) name of the Committee Voting Member, (d) date of review, (e) number of the
				circulation, (f) Voting Member’s decision, and (g) comments. However, when the vote of a Voting Member does not
				require comments during a first circulation, such vote may be transmitted to the Chair in an appropriate alternate
				form.</P>
				<P><B>(2) Voting Categories.</B></P>
				<UL>
					<P>(a) Accept.</P>
					<P>(b) Not accept,</P>
					<UL>
						<P>(i) identification not established</P>
						<P>(ii) natural occurrence questionable.</P>
						<P>(iii) establishment of introduced population questionable.</P>
					</UL>
				</UL>
				<P><B>(3) Abstentions.</B> Voting Members may not abstain from voting.</P>
				<P><B>(4) Secretary and Chair Votes.</B> The Secretary must vote if s/he is also a Voting Member and the Chair
				must vote. On each circulation, such votes must be prior to sending the record to the remaining Members (thus without
				seeing Members’ comments for that circulation).</P>
				<P><B>(5) Comments.</B> On the first circulation, a “not accepted” vote should be supported by appropriate comments.
				On subsequent circulations, either a “not accept” or an “accept” vote should be supported by comments.</P>
				<P><B>(6) Consultations.</B> On the first circulation, a Voting Member should not discuss a record, with intent
				to persuade or lobby for a particular outcome, with another Voting Member prior to both having voted. Discussions
				about the validity of a sighting between observers, commentators or North American Birds editors (for example,
				to determine if such a sighting should be published), is acceptable. On subsequent circulations, pre-vote discussions
				with other Voting Members are acceptable. On any circulation, a Voting Member may consult anyone outside the Committee
				before voting.</P>
				<P><B>(7) Voting Criteria.</B> The criteria used by a Voting Member for acceptance or non-acceptance of a record
				are an individual matter and should not be dictated by these Bylaws. Such criteria might include particular scrutiny
				of records by single or untrustworthy observers, or records not identified to the satisfaction of the reporter.</P>
				<P><B>(8) Change of Voting Member.</B> A circulation in progress at the time a new Voting Member(s) is elected
				should be completed by the retired Voting Member(s), except that removed Voting Members do not qualify; subsequent
				circulations, and hence in some cases final voting, should be completed by new Voting Member(s), except as noted
				in VI.F.(3)(c).</P>
				<P><B>(9) Tabulation.</B> The voting results shall be tabulated by the Secretary after all Voting Members have
				voted.</P>
				<P><B>(10) Decisions During the First Three Circulations.</B> Except as noted under Recirculations (VI. F (3)),
				on any of the first three circulations, with all Voting Members voting,</P>
				<UL>
					<P>(a) A record is considered accepted if it receives no more than one “not accept” vote if the identification
					is considered questionable, or not more than two “not accept” votes if natural occurrence is considered questionable.</P>
					<P>(b) A record is considered not accepted if it receives five or more “not accept” votes.</P>
					<P>(c) A record is not considered to have received a “final” decision and is to be recirculated, or after three
					circulations is to be presented at a meeting, if it receives from two to four “not accept” votes (identification)
					or three to four “not accept” votes (natural occurrence).</P>
				</UL>
				<P><B>(11) Decision During the Fourth Circulation.</B> A record receiving a fourth and final circulation (see VI.F.(3)(c))
				shall have its votes evaluated in the following manner: a record receiving all or all but one “accept” votes shall
				be accepted. A record receiving two or more “not accept” votes in the categories “identification not established”
				or “establishment of introduced population questionable” shall not be accepted. A record receiving three or more
				“not accept” votes in the category “natural occurrence questionable” shall not be accepted. Otherwise the record
				shall be accepted.</P>
				<P><B>(12) Not Accepted Records.</B> Any not accepted record that receives two or more “not accept, identification
				not established” votes will be published as “not accepted, identification not established.” All other not accepted
				records will be published as “not accepted, natural occurrence questionable (identification accepted),” or as “not
				accepted, establishment of introduced population questionable,” whichever receives more votes; ties between these
				two categories shall be decided by the Chair. If a record is not accepted on the basis of either “natural occurrence
				questionable” or “establishment of population questionable,” this shall indicate that identification was accepted.</P>
				<P><B>(13) Supplemental List.</B> The Committee shall maintain a Supplemental List of those species not yet on
				the State List that are “not accepted, natural occurrence questionable” but approved by a majority of Members on
				a final vote as described in Article VI, Section G, Paragraph 11, or at an annual meeting. All records of species
				fitting these criteria which are not yet on the State List, and which a majority did not accept on a final vote,
				shall be brought to the next available annual meeting, where a majority vote will be needed to place the species
				on the Supplemental List. After such a record has been considered at one annual meeting, it shall be brought to
				additional meetings for further consideration only at the request of a Member. A record of a species meeting the
				above criteria, and appearing on the Supplemental List herein described, may be reconsidered at a meeting at the
				request of a Member, but it shall require a two-thirds vote of the Members at such a meeting to delete the record
				from the Supplemental List. If a species is added to the State List, it shall be automatically removed from the
				Supplemental List.</P>
			</UL>
			<P><B>H. Statistical acceptance or non-acceptance of records.</B> The Committee may adopt additional methods of
			dealing with published records of review-listed species for which documentation is not available (an example might
			be records that were supported by specimen and published in an authoritative source, but for which the specimen
			is no longer extant). Such records may be accepted or not accepted for statistical use in the compilation of California
			records without circulating through the Committee. Decisions of this nature may be made at a meeting. Records without
			details may be formally not accepted by majority vote. Any record accepted in this category must receive all, or
			all but one, of the votes of the Members present at such meeting. Any use or publication of such accepted records
