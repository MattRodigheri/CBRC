<P>This report covers 232 records of 95 species submitted to the California Bird Records Committee (hereafter the

CBRC or the Committee). Although most records pertain to birds found in 1996, the period covered by this report

spans the 18 years from 1978 to 1996. Accepted were 178 records involving 71 species. The acceptance rate of 76.7

% was slightly higher than average. Fifty-one records were not accepted because of either insufficient documentation

or the descriptions&#146; being inconsistent with known identification criteria. Four additional records were not accepted

because of questions concerning the bird&#146;s natural occurrence. A considerable effort is made by many observers

to prepare reports and documentation for submittal to the Committee. This report would not be possible without

the 213 observers who submitted reports to the Committee, and we thank them for their efforts.</P>

<P>Counties best represented by accepted records were Orange (27), San Diego (18), Monterey (17), Imperial (12),

Kern, Los Angeles, Riverside and Ventura (9), and San Francisco (8). Records from 18 other counties were accepted.</P>

<P>Highlights of this report include the addition of five species new to the California list: the Swallow-tailed

Gull (<I>Creagrus furcatus</I>), Red-legged Kittiwake (<I>Rissa brevirostris</I>), Ivory Gull (<I>Pagophila eburnea</I>),

White-winged Tern (<I>Chlidonias leucopterus</I>), and Buff-collared Nightjar (<I>Caprimulgus ridgwayi</I>). The

Bristle-thighed Curlew (<I>Numenius tahitiensis</I>), Band-tailed Gull (<I>Larus belcheri</I>), and Couch&#146;s Kingbird

(<I>Tyrannus couchii</I>) also have been accepted but will be treated in subsequent CBRC reports. With these additions,

California&#146;s list stands at 607 species. Other highlights include the acceptance of a Great Frigatebird (<I>Fregata

minor</I>) recorded 18 years ago, a photographed Black Vulture (<I>Coragyps atratus</I>), a record of a Whooper

Swan (<I>Cygnus cygnus</I>) from 10 years ago that was previously not accepted, the fourth occurrence of the Violet-crowned

Hummingbird (<I>Amazilia violiceps</I>), the second and third records of the Cave Swallow (<I>Hirundo fulva</I>),

the state&#146;s second Arctic Warbler (<I>Phylloscopus borealis</I>), and the fourth Eastern Wood-Pewee (<I>Contopus

virens</I>), Smith&#146;s Longspur (<I>Calcarius pictus</I>), and Rustic Bunting (<I>Emberiza rustica</I>). An apparent

hybrid Sandwich (<I>Sterna sandwichensis</I>) X Elegant (<I>S. elegans</I>) Tern was among the most interesting

birds addressed. Potential first state records currently under review are of the Great-winged Petrel (<I>Pterodroma

macroptera</I>), Parkinson&#146;s Petrel (<I>Procellaria parkinsoni</I>), Bulwer&#146;s Petrel (<I>Bulweria bulwerii</I>),

Lesser White-fronted Goose (<I>Anser erythropus</I>), American Woodcock (<I>Scolopax minor</I>), Slaty-backed Gull

(<I>Larus schistisagus</I>), Iceland Gull (<I>Larus glaucoides</I>), Ross&#146; Gull (<I>Rhodostethia rosea</I>), Bridled

Tern (<I>Sterna anaethetus</I>), and Olive-backed Pipit (<I>Anthus hodgsoni</I>).</P>

<P>Michael M. Rogers currently serves as the Committee&#146;s secretary. Past secretary David V. Blue served as CBRC

technical-support specialist in 1998. The ten voting Committee members as of 1 January 1999 are Richard A. Erickson

(chair), Matthew T. Heindel (vice chair), Kimball L. Garrett, Alvaro Jaramillo, Guy McCaskie, Joseph Morlan, Michael

M. Rogers, Stephen C. Rottenborn, Mike San Miguel, and Daniel S. Singer. Recent Committee members who also voted

on many of the records in this report include Shawneen E. Finnegan, Steve N. G. Howell, Michael A. Patten, Peter

Pyle, and Scott B. Terrill.</P>

<P>The list of species reviewed by the CBRC is posted at the Western Field Ornithologists&#146; World Wide Web site

(<A HREF="http://www.wfo-cbrc.org">http://www.wfo-cbrc.org</A>). This site also includes the entire California

state list, the Committee&#146;s bylaws, a reporting form for direct e-mail submission of records to the CBRC, the addresses

of current Committee members, a photo gallery of recent submissions including several birds published in this report,

a list of relevant publications by CBRC members, and other information about the CBRC, WFO, and its journal, <I>Western

Birds</I>.</P>

<P>All records reviewed by the CBRC (including copies of descriptions, photographs, videotapes, audio recordings

and Committee comments) are archived at the Western Foundation of Vertebrate Zoology, 439 Calle San Pablo, Camarillo,

California 93012, and are available for public review. The CBRC solicits and encourages observers to submit documentation

for all species on the review list, as well as species unrecorded in California. Documentation should be sent to

Michael M. Rogers, CBRC Secretary, P. O. Box 340, Moffett Field, CA 94035-0340 (e-mail: <A HREF="mailto:mrogers@nas.nasa.gov">mrogers@nas.nasa.gov</A>).</P>

<P>As in other recent CBRC reports, records are listed geographically, from north to south, and/or chronologically

by first date of occurrence. Included with each record is the location, county abbreviation (see below), and date

span. The date span usually follows that published in <I>Field Notes </I>(formerly <I>American Birds</I>) but,

if the CBRC accepts a date span that differs from a published source, the differing dates are italicized. Initials

of the observer(s) responsible for finding and/or identifying the bird(s)&#151;if known and if they have supplied documentation&#151;are

followed by a semicolon, then the initials, in alphabetized order, of additional observers submitting documentation,

then the CBRC record number consisting of the year of observation and chronological number assigned by the secretary.

All records are sight records unless otherwise indicated: initials followed by a dagger (&#134;) indicate the observer

supplied an identifiable photograph, (&#135;) indicates videotape, (&sect;) indicates a voice recording, and (#) indicates

a specimen record, followed by the acronym (see below) of the institution housing the specimen and that institution&#146;s

specimen catalog number.</P>

<P>An asterisk (*) prior to a species&#146; name indicates that the species is no longer on the CBRC review list. The

first number in parentheses after the species&#146; name is the number of records accepted by the CBRC through this

report; the second is the number of new records accepted in this report (because this number excludes records thought

to pertain to returning individuals, it may be zero). Two asterisks (**) after the species&#146; total indicate that

the number of accepted records refers only to a restricted review period or includes records accepted for statistical

purposes only; see Roberson (1986) for more information.</P>

<P>When individual birds return to a location after a lengthy or seasonal absence, each occurrence is reviewed

under a separate record number, and Committee members indicate whether or not they believe the bird is the same

as one accepted previously. Such decisions follow the opinion of the majority of members and, if a bird is considered

a returning individual, the total number of records remains unchanged.</P>

<P>Although the CBRC does not formally review the age, sex, or subspecies of each bird, information on these subjects

is often provided during the review process (and in some cases a strong or unanimous consensus is achieved). We

have tried to report as much of this information as possible.</P>

<P>The CBRC uses standard abbreviations for California counties; those used in this report are ALA, Alameda; COL,

Colusa; HUM, Humboldt; IMP, Imperial; INY, Inyo; KER, Kern; LA, Los Angeles; MRN, Marin; MEN, Mendocino; MTY, Monterey;

NEV, Nevada; ORA, Orange; RIV, Riverside; SAC, Sacramento; SBT, San Benito; SBE, San Bernardino; SD, San Diego;

SF, San Francisco; SJ, San Joaquin; SLO, San Luis Obispo; SM, San Mateo; SBA, Santa Barbara; SCL, Santa Clara;

SCZ, Santa Cruz; SIS, Siskiyou; SON, Sonoma; VEN, Ventura; YOL, Yolo. A full list of county abbreviations is available

on the WFO-CBRC web site. CBC, Christmas Bird Count; n. miles, nautical miles; N. W. R., national wildlife refuge.</P>

<P>Museum collections housing specimens cited in this report, allowing access to Committee members for research,

or otherwise cited are the California Academy of Sciences, San Francisco (CAS), Natural History Museum of Los Angeles

County (LACM), Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History (PGMNH), San Diego Natural History Museum (SDNHM), Santa

Barbara Museum of Natural History (SBMNH), Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at the University of California, Berkeley

(MVZ), Burke Memorial Museum at the University of Washington, Seattle (UWBM).</P>

<P>RECORDS ACCEPTED</P>

<P>YELLOW-BILLED LOON <I>Gavia adamsii</I> (60, 2). One 1.2 miles N of Otter Point, Pacific Grove, MTY, 7&#150;28 Dec

1993 (SFB, DLSh; 1994-002) and one 0.5 mile W of Point Pinos, MTY, 5 Feb 1996 (LDO-E&#134;; 1996-075) were both on Monterey

Bay where this species has been found almost annually in the past 20 years.</P>

<P>MOTTLED PETREL <I>Pterodroma inexpectata</I> (54, 1). One at 30&deg; 51' N, 121&deg; 35' W (approximately 180

n. miles SW of San Nicolas I., VEN), 1 Apr 1993 (RRV; 1994-025) is the southernmost to be accepted off California.</P>

<P>DARK-RUMPED PETREL <I>Pterodroma phaeopygia</I> (5, 3). One was at 40&deg; 36' N, 125&deg; 57' W (approximately

70 n. miles W of Cape Mendocino, HUM), 27 Jul 1996 (MFo; 1996-141); one was over the Cordell Bank, MRN, 24 Aug

1996 (SBT, MFe; 1996-107); and two were at 33&deg; 39' N, 120&deg; 37' W (approximately 24 n. miles SW of San Miguel

I., SBA), 31 Jul 1996 (RLP, SS; 1996-113). The first documented occurrence in California waters was of one approximately

35 n. miles SW of SE Farallon I., SF, 3 May 1992 (not 70 n. miles SW of Point Reyes, MRN, as reported by Howell

and Pyle 1997), and it now appears that deep waters off California are at the extreme northeast of this species&#146;

pelagic range. As with all records to date, without examining birds in hand, we do not know if the endangered Hawaiian

<I>P. p. sandwichensis</I> or the nominate Galapagos subspecies is involved.</P>

<P>STREAKED SHEARWATER <I>Calonectris leucomelas</I> (7, 1). One 22 miles W of Moss Landing, MTY, 10 Sep 1995 (TE,

MB; 1995-121) was on Monterey Bay. A truly lost individual captured far inland in Red Bluff, TEH, 5 Aug 1993 (Garrett

and Singer 1998) is the only one found in California away from Monterey Bay.</P>

<P>MANX SHEARWATER <I>Puffinus puffinus</I> (22, 10). One was seen from shore at Point Lobos, SF, 4 May 1996 (ASH;

1998-020), one was seen from Pigeon Point, SM, 11 May 1996 (DJP; 1996-077B), and another was seen from this same

point 21 Aug 1996 (PJM; 1997-042). On Monterey Bay, one was 1 mile NW of Point Pinos, MTY, 12 Aug 1995 (DR; 1997-057),

and up to six were seen in 1996: two 1&#150;3 miles W of Point Pinos, MTY, 21 Sep 1996 (DR; 1997-058); one 5 miles S

of Soquel Point, SCZ, 12 Oct 1996 (DR, RMS&#134;; 1997-044); one at an undesignated location on Monterey Bay, MTY, 12

Oct 1996 (LLi&#135;; 1996-142B); one 3 miles S of Santa Cruz, SCZ, 20 Oct 1996 (JND&#134;; 1997-001); and one 5&#150;10 miles

W of Moss Landing, MTY, 20 Oct 1996 (SH, JAT&#134;; 1996-142A). One was seen from shore at Point Piedras Blancas, SLO,

14 Apr 1996 (GPS; 1996-094). With more than twenty records accepted from California waters since 1993 (Erickson

and Terrill 1996) and reports from elsewhere along the west coast of North America (Howell et al. 1994, Roberson

1996, <I>Field Notes</I> 51:1044), this species is proving to be of regular occurrence in the northeast Pacific.</P>

<P>RED-TAILED TROPICBIRD <I>Phaethon rubricauda </I>(18, 6). One of undetermined age was 33 miles W of Point Pinos,

MTY, 24 Sep 1994 (JMD&#134;, DLSh; 1994-149), one adult was 46 miles WSW of Rocky Point, MTY, 16 Sep 1995 (BJR&#134;; 1996-078),

one adult was at 34&deg; 12' N, 121&deg; 28' W (approximately 60 n. miles W of Point Conception, SBA) 25 Nov 1995

(DMH, KL; 1996-043), one immature was at 32&deg; 41' N, 124&deg; 05' W (approximately 195 n. miles SW of Point

Conception, SBA) 10 Oct 1996 (MFo; 1996-144), one calling adult being chased by a Peregrine Falcon (<I>Falco peregrinus</I>)

was over SE Farallon I., SF, 11 Sep 1996 (PP; 1997-040), and one of unknown age was at 37&deg; 32' N, 126&deg;

17' W (approximately 160 n. miles SW of Pt Arena, MEN) 28 Sep 1996 (MFo; 1996-143).</P>

<P>The original documentation for the bird on 16 Sep 1995 was limited to a single photograph. The date and name

of the photographer was added by a Committee member, and the location was stated to be &#147;off Monterey.&#148;

Although the photograph clearly showed an adult Red-tailed Tropicbird, some members were concerned that the name

of the observer, date, and location were &#147;hearsay,&#148; so would not endorse the record. Upon being advised

that the record was in trouble, the photographer wrote a letter stating he photographed this bird on 16 Sep 1995

while on a Shearwater Journeys trip off Monterey. This is another example of the problems this Committee faces

when dealing with a &#147;photo only&#148; record&#151;the Committee needs at a minimum the name of the observer, the

date of the observation, and the exact location of the observation; written comments about the appearance and behavior

of the bird are also solicited. Written documentation from others on the trip, along with a specific location,

would have made this record much easier to evaluate. The specific location and a photograph are published in <I>Field

Notes</I> 50:110.</P>

<P>BLUE-FOOTED BOOBY <I>Sula nebouxii </I>(75**, 5). One captured at a school in Huntington Beach, ORA, 7 Sep 1990

was taken to a wildlife rehabilitation center where it died (DRW; #LACM 109238; 1994-135). One immature at Mystic

L. near Lakeview, RIV, 31 Aug 1996 (MAP; BDS; 1996-108) occurred at the same time that at least three immatures

arrived on the Salton Sea, RIV/IMP (AH, CAM&#134;, MAP; JLD, AME, TEv, MFe, GMcC, SJP, MJSanM, FT; 1996-110): one to

three at the north end of the sea 1&#150;7 Sep, with one remaining through 6 Oct, and one or two at the south end of

the sea 1&#150;7 Sep, with one remaining to 21 Sep.</P>

<P>BROWN BOOBY <I>Sula leucogaster</I> (47, 2). One subadult flew N past Point Mugu, VEN, 22 Apr 1995 (DD; 1995-073).

One adult female was on SE Farallon I., SF, 10 Oct 1996 (PP&#134;; 1997-037).</P>

<P>RED-FOOTED BOOBY <I>Sula sula</I> (12, 1). One subadult at Point La Jolla, SD, 24 May 1996 (PL&#135;; 1996-079) was

initially perched in ornamental bushes at that location, where it had probably spent the night, but flew out over

La Jolla Bay before other birders arrived. This is the first to be recorded in San Diego County.</P>

<P>NEOTROPIC CORMORANT <I>Phalacrocorax brasilianus </I>(8, 4). One immature moved between the Whitewater R. mouth

and the E end of Avenue 67 at the N end of the Salton Sea, RIV, 4 May&#150;1 June 1996 (GMcC, MAP; SJP; 1996-074), two

immatures were on the S shore of the Salton Sea near the Salton Sea N. W. R. headquarters, IMP, 27 Apr 1996 (MAP;

BDS; 1996-068), an adult was at Obsidian Butte at the S end of the Salton Sea, IMP, 1 Sep 1996 (MAP; CAM, GMcC;

1996-109), and up to three immatures were at Fig Lagoon, 2 miles SW of Seeley, IMP, 23 Apr&#150;14 Jun 1996 (KZK&#134;; TRC,

KLG, RL, GMcC, JM, MAP, MMR, MSanM, BDS; 1996-066). These are the first to be found in California in four years

(Heindel and Patten 1996) and, like all previous individuals, were in the southeast corner of the state.</P>

<P>GREAT FRIGATEBIRD <I>Fregata minor </I>(2, 1). An adult male following the beach from Moss Landing to the Salinas

R. mouth, MTY, 13 Oct 1979 (RS, RLB&#134;; 1995-030) was watched by a boatload of birders paralleling the beach. It

was seen and photographed 12 years before the female over SE Farallon I., SF (Heindel and Patten 1996) and believed

at that time to be this species by the observers, even though published as an &#147;unidentified frigatebird&#148;

(<I>Am. Birds</I> 34:195). Documentation was not submitted until after the publication of the detailed paper on

the identification of Great and Magnificent Frigatebirds (Howell 1994) and acceptance of the SE Farallon I. record.</P>

<P>TRICOLORED HERON <I>Egretta tricolor</I> (20**, 5). One immature was at the Tijuana R. mouth, SD, 3 Nov 1995

(GLR; 1996-044), one adult was at Bodega Bay, SON, 17 Sep&#150;1 Oct 1996 (DN&#134;; KB, MFe, SH, JM, BDP; 1996-128), one

immature was at Port Hueneme, VEN, 13 Sep&#150;2 Oct 1996 (MES; DD&#134;, CAM, GMcC, WW; 1996-123), and one immature was

on the Santa Ana R. in Huntington Beach, ORA, 28 Aug&#150;8 Sep 1996 (MD&#135;, JEP; 1997-172). One adult was near the Alamo

R. mouth at the S end of the Salton Sea, IMP, 2 Mar&#150;<I>1 Apr</I> 1996 (MAP; CAM, GMcC, JM, BDS, SS; 1996-032).

This species is a rare but regular fall and winter visitor to coastal San Diego and Orange counties but is irregular

farther north. The bird at Bodega Bay was only the third to be found in northern California (<I>Field Notes </I>51:114).</P>

<P>REDDISH EGRET <I>Egretta rufescens </I>(73, 5). One immature at Salton City, IMP, 15 Aug 1981 (BSh&#134;; 1997-102)

was inland on the Salton Sea, where this species is irregular. One immature was in Chula Vista, SD, 18&#150;23 Dec 1994

(GMcC; 1995-015A), one immature was in Chula Vista, SD, 9 May&#150;17 Jun 1995 (GMcC; 1995-015B), three adults were

at Bolsa Chica, ORA, 10 Jul 1996 (MJSanM; 1996-095), one immature was on the Santa Ana R. in Santa Ana, ORA, 28

Aug&#150;8 Sep 1996 (JEP; 1998-015), and one returning adult was at Imperial Beach, SD, 13 Oct 1996&#150;25 Mar 1997 (GMcC;

1996-145). The latter was the same bird, with a slightly deformed bill, that had spent each winter since the winter

of 1982&#150;83 at the Tijuana R. mouth and on south San Diego Bay (Garrett and Singer 1998).</P>

<P>YELLOW-CROWNED NIGHT-HERON <I>Nyctanassa violaceus </I>(18, 1). An adult at La Jolla, SD, 1 Apr&#150;1 Jun 1996 (GMcC,

JM; 1996-072) was considered to be the same bird first seen in this area in October 1981 (Binford 1985, Erickson

and Terrill 1996). A first-summer bird at Fig Lagoon, 2 miles SW of Seeley, IMP, 27 Apr&#150;30 Jun 1996 (MAP; TRC,

AME, KZK&#134;, GMcC, MMR, BDS; 1996-067) was the first to be found in the interior of California, although long considered

&#147;overdue&#148; at the Salton Sea.</P>

<P>BLACK VULTURE <I>Coragyps atratus </I>(2, 1). One frequenting the Arcata area, HUM, 19 Sep 1993&#150;9 Feb 1994 (RC,

JLD, DF, GCH, TL&#134;, GMcC, JM, DR&#134;; 1993-141) was associating with Turkey Vultures (<I>Cathartes aura</I>). There

was never any question as to the identity of this bird, although its age was never determined with certainty. Initially

three members questioned the origin of this bird, presenting the same arguments listed by Garrett and Singer (1998)

for the Black Vulture at Chico in 1972, but the Arcata record received unanimous approval on the third round. A

photograph of the Arcata bird with a Common Raven (<I>Corvus corax</I>) was published in <I>Am. Birds </I>48:149.</P>

<P>EMPEROR GOOSE <I>Chen canagica </I>(62, 1). One was at Bodega Bay, SON, 12 Dec 1996&#150;30 Apr 1997 (BB, LCo&#134;, MFe,

JMa, GMcC, MAP&#134;, MMR&#134;, MJSanM, SBT&#134;; 1996-146).</P>

<P>WHOOPER SWAN <I>Cygnus cygnus</I> (4, 2). An adult near the intersection of Interstate 5 and Highway 12, SJ,

16 Dec 1988 (MJL; 1988-289) was originally not accepted on the basis of questionable natural occurrence. The decision

was reconsidered after the acceptance of others in California, leading to unanimous approval of this record. One

adult at White L. on Lower Klamath N. W. R., SIS, 26&#150;27 Feb 1994 (JRH, DJP; 1994-074) was considered to be the

same individual at this location during the winter of 1991&#150;92 (Howell and Pyle 1997). One adult near Grimes, COL,

17 Jan&#150;7 Feb 1995 (SH, JM, DEQ, SCR; 1995-020) and again 3&#150;4 Jan 1996 (JM; 1996-038) was considered to be the same

individual. It is possible that all California sightings dating back to the first in 1984, along with those from

Summer L. in southern Oregon, may be of the same individual migrating with Tundra Swans (<I>C. columbianus</I>)

to and from winter grounds in California (Howell and Pyle 1997).</P>

<P>ZONE-TAILED HAWK <I>Buteo albonotatus </I>(53, 5). One adult near Weldon, KER, 3 Oct 1994 (TG, SPR; 1995-024)

was the second to be recorded in Kern County, but one at Santiago Oaks Regional Park, ORA, 30 Apr 1994 (RAH, DRW;

1994-115) was in the coastal lowlands of southern California where small numbers occur regularly every fall and

winter. An adult at Goleta, SBA, 22 Sep 1995&#150;25 Mar 1996 (JEL; 1996-045) and again 24 Oct 1996&#150;22 Mar 1997 (MFe,

JM; 1996-147) was considered to be the same bird that has spent each winter there since the winter of 1993&#150;94 (Lehman

1994, Howell and Pyle 1997). An adult in the upper Ojai Valley near Ojai, VEN, 26 Nov 1995&#150;11 Mar 1996 (CAM; 1996-042)

was thought to be the same individual present there 6 Sep 1993&#150;8 Mar 1994 (Erickson and Terrill 1996); what was

believed to be this same <I>Buteo </I>was also reported near Ojai 28 Aug 1994&#150;17 Feb 1995 (<I>Field Notes</I> 49:196),

but the CBRC has so far received no documentation. One immature at Hermosa Beach, LA, 16 Sep 1996 (KL; 1997-011)

and one at Santee Lakes, SD, 10 Jan 1996 (RMS&#134;; 1997-010) were along the southern California coast. An immature

in El Centro, IMP, 4 Dec 1996&#150;22 Feb 1997 (KZK&#134;; GMcC, MAP; 1996-148) is the first to be accepted in Imperial County.</P>

<P>AMERICAN OYSTERCATCHER <I>Haematopus palliatus </I>(13, 1). One frequenting the coast of Laguna Beach, ORA,

14 Jan&#150;23 Apr 1996 (RAE, CAM, GMcC, MAP&#134;, DEQ&#134;, MJSanM, BDS; 1996-022) was compared directly with Black Oystercatchers

(<I>H. bachmani</I>) and a hybrid <I>H. palliatus</I> X <I>bachmani</I>. On the index provided by Jehl (1985),

this bird scored well within the range of <I>H. p. frazari</I>.</P>

<P>HUDSONIAN GODWIT <I>Limosa haemastica</I> (14, 1). One alternate-plumaged male was at Lower Klamath N. W. R.,

SIS, 31 May 1993 (BDCW; 1997-033).</P>

<P><A NAME="figure1">RED-NECKED STINT <I>Calidris ruficollis </I>(8, 0).</A> One alternate-plumaged adult at the Santa Maria R. estuary,

SBA, 28&#150;29 Jun 1995 (JMC&#134;; TME; 1995-083; <A HREF="figure1.html">Figure 1</A>) was considered the same bird as present

at this location 11&#150;15 Jul 1994 (Howell and Pyle 1997). A photograph was published in <I>Am. Birds</I> 49:980.</P>

<P>WHITE-RUMPED SANDPIPER <I>Calidris fuscicollis </I>(13, 1). One female in worn alternate plumage was at Harper

Dry L., SBE, 10 Sep 1996 (#SBCM 54881; 1997-074).</P>

<P>CURLEW SANDPIPER <I>Calidris ferruginea</I> (21, 3). One in first alternate plumage was at Mountain View, SCL,

1&#150;5 May 1996 (SCR; LCh&#134;, AME, BMcK&#134;, 1996-081). Alternate-plumaged birds were at the Woodland Trestle Ponds, YOL,

5 May 1996 (TMa, JAT; 1997-067) and at the Santa Margarita R. mouth near Oceanside, SD, 10 Jul 1996 (CGE, GHi;

PAG, GMcC; 1996-096).</P>

<P>LITTLE GULL <I>Larus minutus </I>(64, 6). One first-year bird was at Hollister, SBT, 2&#150;15 Mar 1996 (BM, JCW&#134;;

1996-063). One adult in alternate plumage at China Lake, KER, 4&#150;6 May 1996 (TMi; DVB, MTH, JCW; 1996-097) was the

first to be found in the desert portion of Kern County. An adult in basic plumage in Corona, RIV, 8 Nov&#150;13 Dec

1996 (JEP; MAP, WLP; 1996-150) and an adult at nearby Hidden Valley Wildlife Area, RIV, 2 Feb&#150;<I>27</I> Mar 1997

(GMcC, CFT; 1997-076) were considered to be the same bird. Reports from the north end of the Salton Sea, RIV, in

1996 were judged to involve three or four individuals: one adult in basic plumage at the E end of Avenue 76 on

2 Mar 1996 (GMcC; TRC; 1996-033), two adults in alternate plumage at the same location 13 Apr 1996, with one still

present 21 Apr 1996 (GMcC; AS; 1996-073), and one adult in basic plumage at the nearby Whitewater R. mouth 27 May

1996 (MSanM, MJSanM; 1996-082). The species is proving to be of annual occurrence at the Salton Sea.</P>

<P>BLACK-HEADED GULL <I>Larus ridibundus </I>(20, 1). One first-year bird flew north past Pigeon Point, SM, 20

Apr 1996 (RST; 1996-083). One adult in Santa Barbara, SBA, 30 Dec 1994&#150;1 Feb 1995 (JEL; 1995-051) and again 26

Nov 1996&#150;28 Feb 1997 (LCo; GMcC, JM, RMS&#134;; 1997-015) was considered a returning bird, having been present the intervening

winter (Garrett and Singer 1998). A photograph of the Santa Barbara bird was published in <I>Field Notes </I>49:198.</P>

<P>LESSER BLACK-BACKED GULL <I>Larus fuscus </I>(9, 1). One adult in Brawley, IMP, 22&#150;27 Jan 1996 (PEL; TRC, SEF,

GMcC, MAP, BDS; 1996-021) was the fifth to be found around the Salton Sea, and like all previous gulls of this

species in California showed the characteristics of the pale race <I>graellsii</I>. One adult at Doheny State Beach,

ORA, 18 Dec 1995&#150;20 Mar 1996 (CAM; 1996-019) and again 8 Dec 1996&#150;5 Jan 1997 (JDW&#134;; 1997-073) was considered the

same bird at this location during the winter of 1994&#150;95 (Howell and Pyle 1997). An adult in Oceanside, SD, 22 Feb&#150;2

Mar 1996 (PAG; GMcC, KAR&#134;, JWS&#134;; 1996-034) was also considered the same bird as that at Doheny State Beach, having

moved 25 miles south along the coast. A photograph of the bird in Oceanside was published in <I>Field Notes </I>50:222.</P>

<P>SWALLOW-TAILED GULL <I>Creagrus furcatus</I> (1, 1). An adult in alternate plumage seen at 37&deg; 37<I>'</I>

N, 123&deg; 28<I>'</I> W (approximately 15 n. miles W of SE Farallon I., SF) 3 Mar 1996 (LSp; 1996-039), by an

observer with extensive prior experience with this species, is the first to be accepted as a naturally occurring

bird in California. A similarly plumaged adult photographed in Pacific Grove and at nearby Moss Landing, MTY, 6&#150;8

Jun 1985 was considered by the Committee to be of questionable origin (Heindel and Garrett 1995). However, with

the acceptance of the 1996 record, the acceptability of the 1985 bird will be reconsidered. This species has been

reported north to Panama (Ridgely 1976, Reed 1988), but there is no previous unquestioned record in the United

States (AOU 1998).</P>

<P><A NAME="figure2">RED-LEGGED KITTIWAKE <I>Rissa brevirostris </I>(1, 1).</A> One adult (one or two retained dark coverts might suggest

a subadult) captured 13 miles inland at an apartment complex in Anaheim, ORA, 28 Feb 1996 was taken to a wildlife

rehabilitation center where it died 15 Mar 1996 (#LACM 109199; 1996-069; <A HREF="figure2.html">Figure 2</A>). Because

seven individuals have been found in Oregon (Gilligan et al. 1994), and a truly lost bird was captured in Nevada

3 Jul 1977 (Alcorn 1988), this species was anticipated in California. With this bird being inland at the southern

end of the state, the possibility of human assistance was considered. All but one member, however, felt that natural

occurrence was more likely than human assistance.</P>

<P>IVORY GULL <I>Pagophila eburnea</I> (1, 1). One first-winter bird at Doheny State Beach in Dana Point, ORA,

5 Jan 1996 (JDW&#134;; JA&#134;, NBB, TRC, RAE, RAH, IH, C-TL&#134;, LLe, GMcC, MSanM, CR; 1996-012) was the first to be found

in California. This establishes the southernmost record for this species in North America (AOU 1998), and no others

have been found farther south in Europe (Cramp 1993) or Asia (Brazil 1991). The Ivory Gull is more common in the

North Atlantic than in the North Pacific. It is rare south of St. Lawrence I. in Alaska, with only one recorded

in coastal British Columbia (Campbell et al. 1990) and another reported in northern Washington (Roberson 1980 but

considered hypothetical by Wahl and Paulson 1987). Therefore one in southern California was totally unexpected.

Weintraub and San Miguel (1999) provided a full account of this record, including photographs; a photograph also

appeared in <I>Field Notes</I> 50:224.</P>

<P>SANDWICH TERN <I>Sterna sandvicensis </I>(3, 0). An adult paired with an Elegant Tern (<I>Sterna elegans</I>;

Collins 1997) at Bolsa Chica, ORA, 24 Jun&#150;17 Jul 1995 (CTC&#134;; CAM; 1995-071) and again 15 Jun&#150;21 Jul 1996 (NBB;

1996-090) was considered the same bird first seen at this location during the summer of 1991 (Patten et al. 1995).</P>

<P>SOOTY TERN <I>Sterna fuscata </I>(6, 3). An adult at Bolsa Chica, ORA, 6 Jun&#150;24 Aug 1996 (NBB, RL, CAM, GMcC,

JM; 1996-084) was considered the same bird that was with the nesting Elegant Terns at this location during the

summer of 1995 (Howell and Pyle 1997) and first seen there in 1994 (Erickson and Terrill 1996). An adult was at

the Santa Margarita R. mouth, SD, 6 Jul 1996, and a copulating pair was there the following day (BF&#134;; GMcC; 1996-091).

What was possibly the same pair that was at the Santa Margarita R. mouth joined the summering adult at Bolsa Chica

19&#150;24 Jul 1996 (CAM; 1996-119). An adult was at Doheny State Beach in Dana Point, ORA, 30 Jul 1995 (TR; 1995-089).

A photograph of the pair at the Santa Margarita R. mouth was published in <I>Field Notes</I> 50:997.</P>

<P><A NAME="figure3">WHITE-WINGED TERN <I>Chlidonias leucopterus </I>(1, 1).</A> An adult in alternate plumage in Arcata, HUM, 20&#150;26

Jun 1996 and again 27&#150;30 Aug 1996 (NBB, MM, CAM, GMcC, JM, BDP, DR&#134;, MMR&#134;, MSanM; 1996-085; <A HREF="figure3.html">Figure

3</A>) could not be found on the intervening dates. This tern is a very rare to casual straggler along the Atlantic

coast of North America (AOU 1998), with records from as far inland as Wisconsin (Robbins 1991). However, the Arcata

bird is only the fourth to be found on the west coast of North America, the other three having been in Alaska (<I>Am.

Birds </I>47:135 and <I>Field Notes </I>48:331).</P>

<P>THICK-BILLED MURRE <I>Uria lomvia </I>(35, 1). One in basic plumage in Monterey, MTY, 11&#150;16 Feb 1996 (DR, MMR;

1996-102) was in the area where most of California&#146;s Thick-billed Murres have been found.</P>

<P>RUDDY GROUND-DOVE <I>Columbina talpacoti </I>(64, 3). A male at Furnace Creek Ranch, Death Valley, INY, 12 Oct&#150;2

Nov 1996 (GMcC; JH, TH; 1996-151A) and a female there 21 Oct 1996 (MSanM; 1996-151B) were both at a location where

this species has become expected in fall, but one in Ridgecrest, KER, 6&#150;15 Nov 1996 (DVB; 1996-152) was the fifth

to be found in that county.</P>

<P>BLACK-BILLED CUCKOO <I>Coccyzus erythropthalmus</I> (14, 2). One at Fairhaven, HUM, 19 Sep&#150;2 Oct 1996 (DF, GCH;

1997-056) was considered by some on the Committee to be an immature and was the third recorded in Humboldt County.

An adult was collected at San Nicolas Is., VEN, 18 Aug 1996 (WW; MAP&#134;; #SBMNH 6446; 1996-104). The only previous

specimen from California is of a corpse found at Humboldt Bay. Another specimen thought to have been collected

in Fresno in March 1918 was questioned by the Committee (Garrett and Singer 1998). The 18 Aug date establishes

the earliest for California. Previously the earliest record was of one banded on SE Farallon I. 26 Aug 1987. Most

Black-billed Cuckoos depart their breeding range early, so it is not surprising that the 18 Aug to 18 Oct date

span for this species in California is earlier than for most vagrants. All 14 records are for fall.</P>

<P><A NAME="figure4">BUFF-COLLARED NIGHTJAR <I>Caprimulgus ridgwayi </I>(1, 1).</A> A male captured in Oxnard, VEN, 8 Jun 1996 was given

to a wildlife rehabilitation center where it died 6 July 1996 (DD&#134;; #LACM 109297; 1996-120; <A HREF="figure4.html">Figure

4</A>). This bird lost its tail feathers while in the rehabilitation center, but the feathers were saved and deposited

with the body at the Los Angeles County Museum. The species breeds in western Mexico (Howell and Webb 1995), abundantly

in Sonora (Russell and Monson 1998), with the northern limit being in extreme southeastern Arizona (Monson and

Phillips 1981) and southwestern New Mexico (Hubbard 1978). The population in the United States and Sonora withdraws

southward in winter. This species was certainly an unexpected addition to the California list.</P>

<P>BROAD-BILLED HUMMINGBIRD <I>Cynanthus latirostris</I> (50, 4). Males were at Pismo Beach, SLO, <I>16 Nov 1995</I>

(LSu, SSu&#134;; 1996-048), Santa Barbara, SBA, 15&#150;22 Nov 1995 (AB&#134;; 1996-047), Santa Rosa, SON, 14 Jan 1996 (DAH&#134;,

RR, BDP; 1996-062), and Desert Center, RIV, 20&#150;21 Oct 1996 (CMcG; 1996-153). Several CBRC members expressed their

disappointment about the lack of detail accompanying the photograph of the Santa Barbara bird, and we encourage

birders to provide at least a minimum amount of information even when the identity of the photographed bird seems

obvious. The vast majority of records are of coastal vagrants.</P>

<P>VIOLET-CROWNED HUMMINGBIRD <I>Amazilia violiceps</I> (4, 1). One visited Cape Honeysuckle (<I>Tecomaria capensis</I>)

at a residence in east Carlsbad, SD, 13 Nov&#150;3 Dec 1996 (TRC, AME, MFe, RL, GMcC, JM, MAP, RMS&#134;, MSanM, PZ, JOZ;

1996-154). A photograph of this bird appeared on the cover of <I>Western Birds</I> 29 (2), 1998. The first record

in California was at Santa Paula, VEN, 6 Jul&#150;late Dec 1976 (Luther et. al. 1979), the second in Bouquet Canyon,

LA, 25&#150;29 May 1987 (Pyle and McCaskie 1992), and the third at Kenwood, SON, 26&#150;29 Mar 1992 (Heindel and Patten

1996).</P>

<P>GREATER PEWEE <I>Contopus pertinax</I> (31, 1). One in Saticoy, VEN, 21 Jan&#150;21 Feb 1995 (JLD, JTi; 1995-039)

was accepted on the first round and was the first recorded in Ventura County.</P>

<P><A NAME="figure5">EASTERN WOOD-PEWEE <I>Contopus virens</I> (4, 1).</A> A calling individual was in Huntington Beach, ORA, 31 Oct&#150;6

Nov 1996 (BEDa; TRC, MD&#135;, KLG, LLe&#134;, GMcC, MAP, MJSanM, MSanM, LSa&#134;, JOZ; 1996-155; <A HREF="figure5.html">Figure

5</A>). Vocalizations are perhaps the only certain way to distinguish this species in the field from the Western

Wood-Pewee (<I>C. sordidulus</I>), and most of the reports in this record focused on this important distinction.

The voice was variously described as a <I>peee-a-weeee</I> or <I>pee-ur-weeee</I>, which is distinctive and diagnostic

for the Eastern Wood-Pewee. The photographs submitted clearly showed the all-yellowish-orange mandible, and this

field mark combined with the vocalizations led to unanimous first-round acceptance. It is likely that Eastern Wood-Pewees

are overlooked because of the difficulty of identification, and, perhaps for this reason, this species remains

very rarely reported in California. The first recorded in California was banded on SE Farallon Is., SF, 15 June

1975 (Luther 1980), the second was a singing bird in San Joaquin City, SJ, 18 Aug&#150;17 Sep 1983 (Morlan 1985), and

the third was a singing bird on Big Pine Mountain, SBA, 24 Jun&#150;9 Jul 1994 (Pyle and Howell 1997).</P>

<P><A NAME="figure6">YELLOW-BELLIED FLYCATCHER <I>Empidonax flaviventris</I> (7, 1).</A> An immature female observed, then captured and

banded, at San Nicolas I., VEN, 27&#150;28 Sep 1996 (MAP; WW&#134;; 1996-124; <A HREF="figure6.html">Figure 6</A>) was the

first for Ventura County. The wing chord and tail were carefully measured to yield a wing length minus tail length

difference of 11.2 mm, well within the range of this species (DeSante et al. 1985; <A HREF="figure7.html">Figure

7</A>). This and other wing-formula features eliminate the Western (<I>E. difficilis sensu lato</I>) and Acadian

(<I>E. virescens</I>) Flycatchers. The bird&#146;s skull was 50% pneumatized, with the relatively fresh plumage, indicating

a juvenile. The 60 mm wing chord is too short for a male (Pyle 1997). Of previous records, one is for Galileo Hill

Park, KRN, 27 Sep&#150;1 Oct 1989 (Patten and Erickson 1994), the remainder from the coast. Two additional records from

eastern Kern County in 1997 have been accepted and will be treated in the next report, and another found in September

1998 will soon begin circulating through the Committee.</P>

<P>DUSKY-CAPPED FLYCATCHER <I>Myiarchus tuberculifer</I> (38, 2). One was at Pine Lake Park, SF, 30 Nov 1996&#150;1

Mar 1997 (DM, HC; EG&#134; SH, JMa, JM, SBT; 1997-005), and another was at Laguna Creek Beach, SCZ, 14 Dec 1996&#150;19 Jan

1997 (JND; GEC, BMc &#134;; 1997-004). The plaintive <I>pweeerrr</I> call, so useful in identifying this species, was

well described in both records. These late-fall arrival dates and overwinter stays are typical of the Dusky-capped

Flycatcher in California.</P>

<P>GREAT CRESTED FLYCATCHER <I>Myiarchus crinitus</I> (40, 2). One at Newport Beach, ORA, 25 Sep 1995 (JEP; 1998-013)

was not submitted to the Committee until over two years after it was seen but was sufficiently documented for first-round

acceptance. Another was near California City, KER, 4 Oct 1996 (JLD&#134;, STa; MTH&#134;; 1996-156). The description and

photographs clearly show a dark gray breast (not pale or whitish gray), contrasting sharply with the bright yellow

belly, and broad white outer tertial edging. This represents only the fourth inland record and the second for Kern

County.</P>

<P>THICK-BILLED KINGBIRD <I>Tyrannus crassirostris</I> (13, 0). One returned to Pomona, LA, and wintered from 9

Sep 1996 to 2 Mar 1997 for its fifth consecutive year (MSanM; TPB, KB, MFe, SH, JMa, JM, GMcC, SBT, SW; 1996-157).

Its occurrence in the first winter was not supported with documentation (Garrett and Singer 1998).</P>

<P>*SCISSOR-TAILED FLYCATCHER <I>Tyrannus forficatus</I> (97, 3). One was at Carbon Canyon Dam, ORA, 23&#150;27 Oct

1995 (MD&#135;; 1997-173). Another was at Moss Beach, SM, 5 Sep 1996 (DJK; 1997-054), and an adult male was at Zuma

Canyon, LA, 28 April 1996 (RW; HB, TK, NP&#134;; 1996-098). Records after 31 Dec 1997 are no longer reviewed.</P>

<P>YELLOW-THROATED VIREO <I>Vireo flavoviridis</I> (62, 7). A sonogram prepared from a tape-recorded bird observed

at Lincoln Park, SF, 31 May 1994 (ASH&sect;; 1998-021) matched known vocalizations of the species. One was at Carpinteria

Creek, SBA, 6&#150;15 Oct 1995 (JEL; 1996-052), another was in Laguna Canyon, ORA, 27 May 1995 (JEP; 1998-012), another

was at MacKerricher State Park, MEN, 14&#150;15 Sep 1996 (CEV; BEDo, PBS, JW; 1996-167), and a singing bird was at Point

Reyes, MRN, 26 May 1996 (LLi; 1996-087). Others were in Wilmington, LA, 20 Sep&#150;5 Oct 1996 (MSanM, TEW; TK, KL&#134;;

1996-168) and Huntington Beach, ORA, 5&#150;6 Oct 1996 (TEW; MSanM 1996-169).</P>

<P>PHILADELPHIA VIREO <I>Vireo philadelphicus</I> (98, 2). One thought to be an immature was at Pine Gulch Creek,

Bolinas, MRN, 6 Oct 1996 (RS, LLi; 1996-135). One was at Galileo Hill Park, KER, 6&#150;12 Oct 1996 (JLD, MTH&#134;; GMcC,

MJSanM; 1996-170).</P>

<P>YELLOW-GREEN VIREO <I>Vireo flavoviridis</I> (48,5). One at the Carmel River mouth near Mission Ranch, MTY,

5 Oct 1996 (BH; 1997-051) was considered the same as one at the Carmel River mouth, MTY, 28 Sep&#150;14 Oct 1996 (RF;

RC, LJE, DR, CAM, GMcC; 1996-172). An immature was at the Big Sur River mouth, MTY, 22&#150;28 Sep 1996 (JND&#134;; CHo,

DR; 1997-006), and one was in lower Zuma Canyon, LA, 14 Oct 1995 (KLG&#134;; 1996-053). Without the thorough description

included with the latter record, certainty about the identification would have been difficult. This demonstrates

the importance of good documentation, even with photographic evidence, in reports submitted to the CBRC. One was

at Point Loma, SD, 6 Sep 1996 (DWA; PAG, GMcC; 1996-127). This is two days earlier than previously accepted reports

and establishes 6 Sep&#150;30 Oct as the date span for this species. One was at Point Loma, SD, 20 Sep&#150;10 Oct 1996 (PAG;

GLR, GMcC; 1996-173).</P>

<P><A NAME="figure8">BLUE JAY <I>Cyanocitta cristata</I> (10, 1).</A> One visited a feeder at Sea Ranch, SON, for &#147;3 to 4 weeks&#148;

in February 1992 (BRV&#134;; 1995-80; <A HREF="figure8.html">Figure 8</A>). The record was not submitted until three

years after the fact but was nonetheless accepted unanimously on the first round.</P>

<P>CAVE SWALLOW <I>Petrochelidon fulva</I> (3, 2). One was found at Sheldon Reservoir, 4.5 mi. NW of Imperial,

IMP, 6 May 1995 (GMcC, PAG; TRC; 1995-046). Two weeks later another was at the Wister Unit, Imperial Wildlife Area,

IMP, 21 May 1995 (MAP; BDS; 1995-054). The Committee evaluated the possibility that these two sightings could have

been of the same bird, but because of the 15 days and 26 miles separating the two occurrences, most on the Committee

considered them different. The first record for California was near the mouth of the New River, IMP, 8 Aug 1987

(Patten and Erickson 1994).</P>

<P><A NAME="figure9">ARCTIC WARBLER <I>Phylloscopus borealis</I> (2, 1).</A> A well-documented bird was at Pismo Beach, SLO, 28 Sep&#150;1

Oct 1996 (BEDa; NBB, JLD, RL, CAM, JMa, GMcC, BMcK&#134;, JM, DR, MSanM, BSc&#134;, GPS&#134;; 1996-158; <A HREF="figure9.html">Figure

9</A>) and unanimously accepted on the first round. The only other Arctic Warbler in California was one banded

and photographed at Big Sur, MTY, 13 Sep 1995 (Garrett and Singer 1998). Remarkably, before either California record,

one had been recorded on the Vizca&iacute;no Peninsula, Baja California Sur, 12 Oct 1991 (Pyle and Howell 1993).</P>

<P>NORTHERN WHEATEAR <I>Oenanthe oenanthe</I> (9, 1). An immature, so identified by scaling in the back and rusty-edged

coverts (Pyle 1997), was in Sebastopol, SON, 17&#150;26 Sep 1996 (DN, BDP, ANW; JMa, JM; 1996-132). A photograph appeared

in <I>Field Notes</I> 51:116. Most wheatears in California have been observed for only one day, so it is unusual

that this bird stayed for ten. The tail pattern as described ruled out other species of wheatears, but whether

the bird was <I>O. o. oenanthe</I> or <I>O. o. leucorhoa</I>, the larger race from Greenland and Iceland, was left

undetermined.</P>

<P>WOOD THRUSH <I>Hylocichla mustelina</I> (12, 3). One was at the Cosumnes River Preserve, SAC, 7&#150;10 Jun 1996

(JAT&sect;; KCK; 1996-134). Another was banded and released at the Sagehen Field Station near Truckee, NEV, on

19 Jun 1996 (JK; 1997-031). In-hand data, including length and wing chord, convinced the Committee the identification

was correct. Unfortunately, photographs, which would have verified the identification further, were not taken.

Banders and others handling rarities are encouraged to take photographs to accompany their reports. Another was

at Mountain Home Village, SBE, 21&#150;26 Dec 1996 (MFe, GMcC, MSanM; 1996-161). Most California Wood Thrush records

are for late spring and fall, making the late December date unusual.</P>

<P>RUFOUS-BACKED ROBIN <I>Turdus rufopalliatus</I> (8, 1). One in Borrego Springs, SD, 16 Mar&#150;16 Apr 1996 (KE;

TRC, PAG, GCH, RL, CRM, GMcC, JM, DEQ, MAP, MSanM, BDS, BMS; 1996-061) was the first record for San Diego County

of a species long anticipated.</P>

<P>GRAY CATBIRD <I>Dumetella carolinensis</I> (81, 10). One was at Point Reyes, MRN, 18&#150;27 Sep 1996 (KB; MFe, LLi&#135;,

JM, BDP; 1996-129), and another was on SE Farallon I., SF, 29 Oct&#150;2 Nov 1996 (PP&#134;; 1997-034). Remarkably, three

were banded and photographed at one location during the summer of 1996: a one-year-old bird was at Big Sur River

Mouth, MTY, 13&#150;18 Jun 1996 (DR&#134;; 1996-086), another 17 Jun&#150;2 Jul 1996 (DR; 1996-125), and a third 2&#150;18 Jul 1996

(SB; 1996-126). Others were at Panamint Springs, INY, 29 May 1996 (JM; 1996-101), Arroyo de la Cruz Creek, SLO,

29 Sep 1996 (GPS; 1996-130), Big Sycamore Canyon, VEN, 19 Oct 1996 (TRC, GMcC; 1996-159), Desert Center, RIV, 16&#150;17

Nov 1996 (WJM; MAP; 1996-160), and Costa Mesa, ORA, 22 Dec 1996&#150;19 Feb 1997 (JEP; RL, MJSanM; 1996-041). The majority

of records are of coastal vagrants.</P>

<P>YELLOW WAGTAIL <I>Motacilla flava</I> (10, 1). One at Arcata, HUM, 27 Aug 1996 (DF; EE; 1996-162) was the second

for Humboldt County and extends the species&#146; period of occurrence in California 10 days earlier than previously

accepted records.</P>

<P>BLACK-BACKED WAGTAIL <I>Motacilla lugens</I> (8, 2). An adult was at Caspar Creek State Beach, MEN, 27&#150;30 Sep

1996 (JW; KKC, MD&#135;, GEC, BEDo, DE&#134;, BK; 1996-163). A remarkably well documented immature male was along lower San

Juan Creek, Dana Point/San Juan Capistrano, ORA, 25 Jan&#150;12 Apr 1996 (TR, CAM, MAP; TRC, MD, SRG, GCH, RL, GMcC,

JM, DEQ, WLP, RMS, MJSanM, MSanM, BDS, JHT, JDW&#134;; 1996-023). The Committee&#146;s decision regarding identification

was greatly simplified by the thorough documentation, which included a daily chronicle of the bird&#146;s activities.

During the first few days of this bird&#146;s stay, it was uncertain whether it was <I>M. alba</I> or <I>M. lugens</I>,

but a few astute observers had determined early that it was a Black-backed Wagtail. Initially some thought the

bill was small, indicating a female but as the bird molted it revealed itself a male. Descriptions and photographs

spanning most of the period the bird was present show the back changing from gray with a few black feathers to

completely black. The inner tertials were retained juvenile feathers, indicating the bird was in its first year.

This constitutes the first record for Orange County and the southernmost for California. One adult male at Doheny

State Beach, ORA, 27 Sep&#150;7 Oct 1996 (JDW&#134;; JLD, MSanM, MJSanM; 1996-164) was considered to be the same bird returning

from the previous year. Its sudden disappearance, when it appeared to have settled in to spend a second winter,

suggested possible predation (<I>Field Notes </I>51:121). Sibley and Howell (1998) analyzed and discussed the identification

of Black-backed and White Wagtails thoroughly.</P>

<P>SPRAGUE&#146;S PIPIT <I>Anthus spragueii</I> (25, 2). One at China Lake Naval Station, KER, 20&#150;22 Oct 1996 (DVB&#134;;

MTH; 1996-166) made the first record for Kern County. Another was at San Joaquin Marsh, ORA, 19&#150;20 Oct 1996 (BEDa;

LB&#134;, RAH, MTH&#134;, MJSanM, MSanM; 1996-165).</P>

<P>GOLDEN-WINGED WARBLER <I>Vermivora chrysoptera</I> (55, 1). A female was at Atwater near the Los Angeles River,

LA, 1&#150;3 Mar 1996 (DM; KLG, CAM, MSanM; 1996-040). The early March date suggests the bird had probably spent the

winter.</P>

<P>GRACE&#146;S WARBLER <I>Dendroica graciae</I> (32, 1). Excursions by several groups to Clark Mountain in northeastern

San Bernardino County 22 May&#150;14 Jun 1995 yielded at least one male (MSanM; DVB&#134;, MAP, BDS, SBT; 1995-059); a female

there 3 June 1995 was reported previously (Garrett and Singer 1998). Some parties heard vocalizations that quite

possibly were from another male Grace&#146;s Warbler, but the documentation submitted to the Committee was ambiguous.

Over the years a number of parties have made the difficult hike into the White Fir (<I>Abies concolor</I>) forest

of Clark Mountain looking for Grace&#146;s Warblers, producing seven of the accepted records for California. Though

long suspected, breeding has never been confirmed there.</P>

<P>WORM-EATING WARBLER <I>Helmitheros vermivorus </I>(80, 1). One at Point Loma, SD, 12 Oct 1995 (DWA; 1996-057)

was reported as an adult. With current knowledge, it is not possible to determine age of fall birds unless skulling,

plumage measurements, or other in-hand techniques are used (Pyle 1997).</P>

<P>CONNECTICUT WARBLER <I>Oporornis agilis</I> (78, 1). One was on SE Farallon I., SF, 1 Oct 1995 (CA, PP; 1995-139).

This was the fourth Connecticut Warbler recorded on the island during fall 1995; the other three were covered by

Garrett and Singer (1998).</P>

<P>MOURNING WARBLER <I>Oporornis philadelphia</I> (97, 4). Well-described birds were at Stinson Beach, MRN, 15

Sep 1993 (SNGH; 1998-009) and at Bolinas, MRN, 30 Sep 1993 (SNGH; 1998-010). A bird found at the Fitzgerald Marine

Preserve near Moss Beach, SM, 1 Oct 1996 (SBT; 1996-136) was the first for San Mateo County. An immature was at

the Carmel River mouth, MTY, 11&#150;13 Oct 1996 (AME, MFe, DR; 1996-137).</P>

<P>RED-FACED WARBLER <I>Cardellina rubrifrons</I> (10, 1). One was at Point Loma, SD, 29 May 1996 (PAG; 1996-099).

Of the ten state records, eight are for spring, two for fall.</P>

<P>SCARLET TANAGER <I>Piranga olivacea</I> (92, 3). A female in Wilmington, LA, 23&#150;27 May 1994 (DMH; KL, RAH; 1994-100)

was accepted on the third round of voting. In the first two rounds many members thought the details insufficient

to uphold the record, but subsequent additional detail and an additional corroborating report brought unanimous

support. Another female, which came aboard a research vessel south of San Clemente I., LA, (32&deg; 20<I>'</I>

N, 118&deg; 30<I>'</I> W) 9 Oct 1993 (RRV: 1994-043) was finally accepted on the fourth round of voting. An immature

male was on San Clemente I., LA, 17 Oct 1996 (GMcC; 1996-176).</P>

<P>SMITH&#146;S LONGSPUR <I>Calcarius pictus</I> (4, 1). What was considered to be an immature male was at Galileo Hill

Park, KER, 10 Oct 1996 (DVB; BSm&#134;, GHa, AH; 1996-138). The entirely buffy underparts with streaking and white spot

at the back of the auriculars are diagnostic for this species. Age and sex were determined by the buffy edges on

the primary and secondary coverts and the tertials. It was the first to be found in southern California. Dunn and

Beadle (1998) provided an excellent discussion of the identification of this and other longspurs and included two

photographs of this individual.</P>

<P>RUSTIC BUNTING <I>Emberiza rustica</I> (4, 1). An individual discovered during the Willow Creek CBC in Hoopa,

HUM, 23 Dec 1995 remained until 3 Feb 1996 (TAC, JLD, KLG, RL, CAM, JM, GMcC, WLP, DEQ, MMR&#134;, RR, MSanM, DLSh;

1996-008). Poorly documented reports of a second bird at this location were discussed but dismissed by the Committee.</P>

<P>PYRRHULOXIA <I>Cardinalis sinuatus</I> (13, 1). An adult male was in El Centro, IMP, 28 May&#150;5 Jun 1996 (CGE;

1996-122). Not surprisingly, most records of this species are from desert locations in southern California, with

one exceptional record for San Miguel Is., SBA, 13&#150;19 June 1990 (Heindel and Garrett 1995). Accepted records extend

from 18 Dec to 22 Jul.</P>

<P>PAINTED BUNTING <I>Passerina ciris</I> (54, 4). An immature male with a badly worn tail in the Tijuana R. valley,

SD, 24 Aug 1993 (DWA, CHR; 1994-045) was finally accepted on the third round. Like so many previous male Painted

Buntings that have not been accepted because of the possibility of escape from captivity, this bird was initially

considered suspect, but comments from Pyle suggested that because males retain juvenile rectrices well into the

fall, it is normal for their tails to be worn in August. One at Huntington Beach, ORA, 4 Sep&#150;24 Oct 1994 (CAM;

1994-150) was seen by many observers, but only one report was received. This bird&#146;s ragged appearance was attributed

by some on the Committee to cage wear but others, as in the preceding record, argued this condition could be due

to normal plumage wear. The record was finally accepted on the third round. Another was in California City, KER,

1 Sep 1996 (MTH; 1996-177), and one was in Huntington Beach, ORA, 15 Sep 1996 (JEP; 1998-016). Understanding molt

sequences and timing is essential to assessing the age and sex of birds in the field accurately, and observers

are encouraged to use the ever-expanding literature dealing with that subject, especially Pyle (1997).</P>

<P>COMMON GRACKLE <I>Quiscalus quiscula</I> (36, 2). A male at Iron Mountain, SBE, 11 Oct 1984 (RLMcK&#134;; 1996-139)

was accepted even though over 13 years had elapsed from when the bird was observed. In spite of the lengthy delay

in submitting this documentation, the photographs and accompanying description were sufficient for unanimous first-round

acceptance. Another was at Canebrake, KER, 22&#150;28 Oct 1995 (DLaB&#134;; MOC; 1996-060). All of the Common Grackles in

California have been of the bronzed form <I>Q. q. versicolor</I>.</P>

<P>STREAK-BACKED ORIOLE <I>Icterus pustulatus</I> (6, 1). One was at Bartlett Park, Huntington Beach, ORA, 29 Dec

1996&#150;27 Mar 1997 (JEP; MFe, KLG, KCK, CAM, JMa, JM, GMcC, MAP, PPi, RWR, MJSanM, MSanM&#134;, BSm&#134;, MET&#134;, SBT, CFT,

JAW, JOZ; 1996-178). A photograph appeared in <I>Field Notes </I>51:805. We appreciate the several reports from

out-of-state birders. The last record of this species was of one at Gene Pumping Plant, near Parker Dam, SBE, 9&#150;18

Dec 1991 (Patten et al. 1995). All records of this species in California (including one collected at Lake Murray,

San Diego, SD, 1 May 1931; Huey 1931) are thought to represent <I>I. p. microstictus</I> from northwestern Mexico.</P>

<P>RECORDS NOT ACCEPTED, identification not established</P>

<P>ARCTIC LOON <I>Gavia arctica</I>. In general Committee members are reluctant to endorse records of extreme rarities

with common similar relatives without some confirmation from other observers or photographs. One reported by a

single observer at Bodega Bay, SON, 16 Nov 1996 (1996-140) received little support.</P>

<P>YELLOW-BILLED LOON <I>Gavia adamsii</I>. Photographs of a large loon at the harbor in Ventura, VEN, 3 Jan 1995

(1996-029) were not accompanied by written documentation and were not of sufficient quality to convince all members

of the bird&#146;s identity. We once again encourage reporters to submit written documentation with photographs.</P>

<P>DARK-RUMPED PETREL <I>Pterodroma phaeopygia</I>. A light-bodied <I>Pterodroma</I> seen from SE Farallon I.,

SF, 20 May 1988 (1997-131) was identified as this species nine years after the observation. The record was endorsed

by four members; the remaining six felt the bird was most likely a Dark-rumped Petrel but considered the documentation

inadequate to support a first North American record.</P>

<P>GREATER SHEARWATER <I>Puffinus gravis</I>. A shearwater seen in the Gulf of the Farallones, SF, 15 Oct 1995

(1995-123) may have been this species. However, inconsistencies in the documentation persuaded virtually all members

to treat the report with caution and refrain from endorsing the record.</P>

<P>MANX SHEARWATER <I>Puffinus puffinus</I>. The documentation for a small black and white shearwater seen briefly

from SE Farallon I., SF, 13 Sep 1996 (1997-041) was considered inadequate to support the record. This shearwater

was seen closer, and for a longer period, by an observer from Great Britain familiar with this species. However,

the British observer failed to provide documentation.</P>

<P>MASKED BOOBY <I>Sula dactylatra</I>. The documentation for a black and white booby at San Miguel I., SBA, 11

Jan 1993 (1994-059) was insufficient to support the identification as a Masked Booby. The written account of the

observation and the drawing of the bird were prepared more than one year after the sighting. Most Committee members

question the accuracy of such documentation. In this case, the drawing shows black on the secondaries extending

to and including the tertials, but the written account does not address this crucial point, and the observer did

not state why the bird was not a Red-footed Booby.</P>

<P>BLUE-FOOTED BOOBY <I>Sula nebouxii</I>. The description of a booby seen perched on E Anacapa I., VEN, 31 Aug

1995 (1994-208) was inadequate to establish the identity to species.</P>

<P>RED-FOOTED BOOBY <I>Sula sula</I>. An all-dark booby photographed 5.5 miles S of Soquel Point, SCZ, 10 July

1996 (1996-103) was believed by the observer to be this species. However, most Committee members felt a young Brown

Booby could not be eliminated, so the record was not accepted.</P>

<P>ANHINGA <I>Anhinga anhinga</I>. Two were reported soaring high above Westminster, ORA, 2 Nov 1994 (1995-023),

but all Committee members felt the documentation was inadequate to support such a significant record. Captive African

Darters (<I>A. melanogaster rufa</I>) are on display in California at such places as the San Diego Wild Animal

Park and have the potential to escape. Therefore reports of the Anhinga should include enough detail to eliminate

the other species of <I>Anhinga</I>.</P>

<P>YELLOW-CROWNED NIGHT-HERON <I>Nyctanassa violaceus</I>. One reported at Playa del Rey, LA, 15 Apr 1995 (1995-075)

lacked documentation adequate to persuade most Committee members to endorse the record.</P>

<P>BAR-HEADED GOOSE <I>Anser indicus</I>. The documentation for a goose reported at Lower Klamath N. W. R., SIS,

during the week of 18 Mar 1959 (<I>Audubon Field Notes</I> 13:311, Wilbur and Yocum 1971, Cogswell 1977; 1993-104)

was inadequate to support the identification as a Bar-headed Goose. Furthermore, most agreed that if it were correctly

identified, it was most likely an escaped bird. There are no accepted records of this species in North America,

and it is common in captivity.</P>

<P>TRUMPETER SWAN <I>Cygnus buccinator</I>. Three swans seen only in flight at Modoc N. W. R., MOD, 7 Feb 1993

(1997-199) and a swan seen near Grimes, COL, 7 Feb 1995 (1995-022) were identified primarily on the basis of the

green neck collars they were wearing. The Committee has conflicting information on whether green collars have been

placed only on Trumpeter Swans or on both Trumpeter and Tundra (<I>C. columbianus</I>) Swans. If it were proven

that green collars have been placed only on Trumpeter Swans, the Committee would then face the problem of &#147;viable

population not established,&#148; since many of these marked swans originate from highly managed transplanted populations

(see discussion below).</P>

<P>KING EIDER <I>Somateria spectabilis</I>. A dead duck photographed on the beach in San Francisco, SF, 26 Dec

1995 (1997-030) as part of the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary Beachwatch Program was identified

as this species. The coloration on the underparts clearly shows it was not a young male King Eider as identified

but more likely a Gadwall (<I>Anas strepera</I>).</P>

<P>MISSISSIPPI KITE <I>Ictinia mississippiensis</I>. The documentation for one reported in Bishop, INY, 20 June

1994 was inadequate to persuade half the voting members to endorse this record.</P>

<P>AMERICAN OYSTERCATCHER <I>Haematopus palliatus</I>. Two black-and-white oystercatchers at Crystal Cove State

Park/Laguna Beach, ORA, 3&#150;5 Sep 1995 (1996-028) were given a score of 18 by one of the observers using Jehl&#146;s (1985)

character index, so they were considered hybrid <I>H. palliatus</I> X <I>bachmani</I> by the Committee.</P>

<P>SPOTTED REDSHANK <I>Tringa erythropus</I>. A <I>Tringa </I>seen at Winchester, RIV, 28 Sep 1996 (1996-131) was

reported to look like a yellowlegs but to have red legs. It was never seen in flight or heard calling. Most Committee

members felt a record of such a rarity should be supported by a description that at a minimum included the extent

of the white on the back and rump.</P>

<P>BAR-TAILED GODWIT <I>Limosa lapponica</I>. A godwit at San Elijo Lagoon, SD, 27 Aug 1995 (1996-046) may have

been this species, but a majority of the Committee did not believe that a pale Marbled Godwit was eliminated.</P>

<P>RED-NECKED STINT <I>Calidris ruficollis</I>. The documentation for one reported at the Santa Maria R. mouth,

SBA, 31 Aug 1996 (1997-013) was considered by all to be inadequate to support the identification. Observers are

cautioned that the Committee has consistently required detailed documentation that clearly establishes not only

the age but also the plumage, alternate or basic, for all of these notoriously difficult-to-identify stints.</P>

<P>LITTLE STINT <I>Calidris minuta</I>. An adult alternate-plumaged &#147;peep&#148; at Bolinas Lagoon, MRN, 30

Aug 1995 (1995-109) was felt by most Committee members to be either a Little or Red-necked Stint, but none was

willing to commit to a more specific identity.</P>

<P>WHITE-RUMPED SANDPIPER <I>Calidris fuscicollis</I>. The documentation for a basic-plumaged adult reported at

Point Mugu, VEN, 24 Aug 1996 (1997-014) was felt to be inadequate to document such a rarity.</P>

<P>CURLEW SANDPIPER <I>Calidris ferruginea</I>. A basic-plumaged <I>Calidris</I> reported on Upper Newport Bay,

ORA, 2 Jan 1995 (1995-041) may have been a Curlew Sandpiper. However, the unprecedented date (mid-winter), along

with the fact that others trying to relocate this bird found a Stilt Sandpiper (<I>C. himantopus</I>) at the location,

left the record with only three Committee members endorsing it on the third round.</P>

<P>SANDWICH TERN <I>Sterna sandvicensis</I>. A medium-sized tern with Elegant Terns at the Pajaro R. mouth, MTY,

4&#150;11 Jul 1995 (1995-084) closely matched this species. The bill was black with a yellow tip but, unlike any known

Sandwich Tern, also had red along the basal two-thirds of the tomia. One observer sent his notes and photographs

(notes and photographs not returned, and presumed lost) to the late Claudia P. Wilds, and her response, attached

to the record, concluded the bird was a two-year-old hybrid Sandwich X Elegant Tern. The Committee always agreed

that this tern was either a Sandwich or, more likely, a hybrid, and, after three rounds of review, all but one

member agreed it was most likely the latter, the single dissenter still supporting the identification as a Sandwich

Tern.</P>

<P>Single Sandwich Terns have been found with nesting Elegant Terns in San Diego and Orange counties since 1980

(Schaffner 1981) and hybridized with an Elegant Tern in Orange County in 1995 (Collins 1997). We do not know the

bill color of adult first-generation hybrid Sandwich X Elegant Terns but can arrive at a probable conclusion from

information on similar-aged Sandwich X Lesser Crested Terns (<I>S. bengalensis</I>) in Europe. Lesser Cresteds

appear similar to Elegant Terns and, like Elegant Terns, have orange bills. Sandwich Terns have been documented

successfully hybridizing with Lesser Crested Terns in England and France (Steele and McGuigan 1989, Jiguet 1997,

Dies and Dies 1998). Two different adult presumed first-generation hybrid Sandwich X Lesser Crested Terns in England

were described as identical to adult Sandwich Terns, with the bill mainly black. One had a prominent yellow line

along the upper third of the lower mandible, the yellow tip more extensive, and small areas of yellow around the

nostril and gape (Gillon and Stringer 1994); the other had a crescent of yellow on the middle half of its maxilla

(Baxter 1996). The yellow on the bill of these two presumed first-generation hybrids appears to match the red on

the bill of the presumed hybrid Sandwich X Elegant Tern in Monterey County closely.</P>

<P>THICK-BILLED MURRE <I>Uria lomvia</I>. A dead murre photographed on a beach at Limantour Spit, MRN, &#147;2-11-94&#148;

(2 Nov or 11 Feb?&#151;we encourage contributors not to use this date format) (1996-031) as part of the Gulf of the

Farallones National Marine Sanctuary Beachwatch Program was believed by all Committee members to be a Common (<I>U.

aalge</I>) rather than a Thick-billed as originally identified from the photograph.</P>

<P>PARAKEET AUKLET <I>Aethia psittacula</I>. A dead auklet photographed on a beach at Limantour Spit, MRN, &#147;3-12-95&#148;

(3 Dec or 12 Mar ?) (1996-085) as part of the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary Beachwatch Program

was clearly a Cassin&#146;s (<I>Ptychoramphus aleuticus</I>) rather than a Parakeet as originally identified.</P>

<P>RUDDY GROUND-DOVE <I>Columbina talpacoti</I>. A small dove at Furnace Creek Ranch, Death Valley, INY, 30 Nov

1995 (1995-124) may have been this species, but the documentation was insufficient to persuade more than four members

to support the record.</P>

<P>GREATER PEWEE <I>Contopus pertinax</I>. One at the San Diego Zoo, SD, 19 Sep&#150;7 Nov 1993 (1994-061) went three

rounds and was not accepted by a vote of 7&#150;3, lacking sufficient detail to convince a few Committee members.</P>

<P>DUSKY-CAPPED FLYCATCHER <I>Myiarchus tuberculifer</I>. One reported at Sepulveda Basin, Encino, LA, 1 Oct 1996

(1996-049) was silent and was about a month earlier than usual, causing concern among several Committee members.</P>

<P>SULPHUR-BELLIED FLYCATCHER <I>Myiodynastes luteiventris.</I> One was reported at the Twentynine Palms Marine

Corps Base golf course, SBE, 26 Sep 1995 (1996-050). The brief description was insufficient to address width of

the malar stripe, bill color and size, amount of white in the chin, and other marks required to separate the Sulphur-bellied

from other species such as the Streaked (<I>M. maculatus</I>), Piratic (<I>Legatus leucophaius</I>), and Variegated

<I>(Empidonomus variegatus) </I>Flycatchers, which may range great distances during post-breeding dispersal and

have turned up in North America. Had this record been accepted it would have been the first for an inland location

in California. Another reported at Point Reyes, MRN, 1 Oct 1996 (1997-055) was not accepted because the report

lacked sufficient detail. Likewise, some on the Committee thought the Streaked and Variegated Flycatchers had not

been ruled out.</P>

<P>*SCISSOR-TAILED FLYCATCHER <I>Tyrannus forficatus.</I> One reported as a &#147;flyover&#148; at Vidal Wash,

SBE, 24 Jun 1995 (1995-067) was seen for only a few seconds. The identification was based solely on size and shape,

and the observer was unable to provide sufficient detail for the Committee to accept, even though this is a relatively

straightforward identification.</P>

<P>ROSE-THROATED BECARD <I>Pachyramphus aglaiae.</I> One reported in Ventura, VEN, 31 Mar 1996 (1996-121) was inadequately

documented. There are no accepted records for California.</P>

<P>SEDGE WREN <I>Cistothorus platensis</I>. One was reported from the Hayward Regional Shoreline, ALA, 16&#150;17 Oct

1994 (1994-188). While most of the Committee thought the bird described was a Sedge Wren, the record lacked support

because of inconsistencies with known field marks and an apparent lack of confidence from the observer about his

sighting.</P>

<P>VEERY <I>Catharus fuscescens</I>. One reported near Moss Landing, MTY, 19 May 1995 (1995-068) generated much

discussion about the fine points and pitfalls in identifying this species, difficult to separate from Swainson&#146;s

and other <I>Catharus </I>thrushes. Most Committee members thought the description of the eyering and face were

inconsistent with a typical Veery. The date was considered early by several members. Observers are cautioned to

be especially careful when identifying rarities of this genus.</P>

<P>RUFOUS-BACKED ROBIN <I>Turdus rufopalliatus</I>. One reported at the headquarters of the Salton Sea N. W. R.,

IMP, 21 Oct 1995 (1996-064) was considered by most on the Committee to be inadequately described. Additional concern

was raised by the date, two weeks earlier than the earliest accepted date for this species in California.</P>

<P>YELLOW WAGTAIL <I>Motacilla flava</I>. A single bird reported from Hayward Regional Shoreline, ALA, 6 Oct 1993

(1995-010) was not accepted on the second round of voting. Many of the field marks seemed correct but not diagnostic.

Yellow Wagtails are normally quite vocal, and most on the Committee felt that during the 22 minutes the bird was

observed it should have vocalized; the call would have clinched the identification. The 6 Oct date is about two

weeks later than the previously established late date for this species in California.</P>

<P>SPRAGUE&#146;S PIPIT <I>Anthus spragueii</I>. One reported from the Carrizo Plains, SLO, 9 Jan 1996 (1996-25) was

believed by some to be correctly identified, but the vocalizations, time of the year, and behavior raised caution

among many on the Committee. The description of another bird seen aboard a research vessel southeast of San Clemente

Is., LA, 10 Oct 1995 (1996-051) did not rule out other pipit species such as the Red-throated (<I>A. cervinus</I>)

and even American (<I>A. rubescens</I>) and was not accepted.</P>

<P>GRACE&#146;S WARBLER <I>Dendroica graciae</I>. One on the Oxnard Plain, VEN, 23 Sep 1995 (1996-054) was thought by

most members to be a Grace&#146;s but was not sufficiently documented to secure enough support. Over a dozen people

saw the bird but only the initial observer sent documentation to the Committee. Reports from others could have

provided the additional details required for acceptance. If additional details are submitted the record could be

re-evaluated.</P>

<P>PINE WARBLER <I>Dendroica pinus</I>. One was reported on the Oxnard Plain, VEN, 7 Oct 1995 (1996-055). Many

details in the description, including the short tail, are incorrect for the Pine Warbler, and many on the Committee

did not think that the Prairie Warbler (<I>D. discolor</I>) had been eliminated. Pine Warblers tend to be late

fall vagrants, some remaining through the winter, so the rather early date was cause for concern.</P>

<P>CERULEAN WARBLER <I>Dendroica cerulea</I>. One reported at Iron Mountain, SBE, 21 Apr 1996 (1996-088) received

no support because it was insufficiently documented. The April date was unprecedented, being nearly four weeks

earlier than the previously established early date for this species in California. While rarities can occur at

almost any time, they tend to appear during well-defined windows during the year. An understanding of the spatial

and temporal distribution of vagrants is a factor important in claims of their occurrence.</P>

<P>WORM-EATING WARBLER <I>Helmitheros vermivorus</I>. One reported from the Santa Clara River estuary, VEN, 21

Oct 1983 (1994-068) lacked sufficient detail and accuracy about plumage color. Some thought the Orange Bishop (<I>Euplectes

franciscanus</I>), which has a similarly striped head,<I> </I>was not eliminated. Some introduced species can cause

a great deal of confusion with similarly appearing North American birds, and knowledge about the ever-expanding

variety and populations of non-native birds is critical to identifying vagrants (Garrett 1998).</P>

<P>PAINTED BUNTING <I>Passerina ciris</I>. One immature male reported near Cabrillo Beach, LA, 14 Oct 1995 (1996-058)

was not accepted because the description was inadequate.</P>

<P>COMMON GRACKLE <I>Quiscalus quiscula</I>. A male photographed at Furnace Creek Ranch, Death Valley, INY, 28

May 1996 (1996-089) was considered by most on the Committee to be a Brewer&#146;s Blackbird (<I>Euphagus cyanocephalus</I>).

Another at Capitola, SCZ, 24&#150;26 Jan 1994 (1994-069) was not accepted because several members felt confusion with

the Great-tailed Grackle (<I>Q. mexicanus</I>) was possible.</P>

<P>COMMON REDPOLL <I>Carduelis flammea</I>. Up to three, with one roughly sketched, were reported from Mountain

Home Village, SBE, 13 Jan 1996 (1996-071). The documentation was unacceptable for such an unprecedented record.

The only accepted records in California are from the extreme north and northeast.</P>

<P>RECORDS NOT ACCEPTED, Identification accepted but natural occurrence questionable</P>

<P>GRAY SILKY-FLYCATCHER <I>Ptilogonys cinereus</I>. One at Point Loma, SD, 24 May 1993 (NW, REW; 1993-115) had

a worn tail and other abnormalities associated with a caged bird. This is the third record submitted to the Committee,

and because of questionable natural occurrence none has been accepted. Several Committee members suggested that

a pattern of occurrence in Arizona, where no accepted record exists, should emerge before this species is accepted

as naturally occurring in California. One CBRC member suggested that this species is a candidate for occurrence

in California because it occurs quite far north in Mexico. Furthermore, it may be noteworthy that all of the reports

for California have been in the spring at a time when large flocks of the berry-eating Cedar Waxwing (<I>Bombycilla

cedrorum</I>) are on the move in California.</P>

<P>PAINTED BUNTING <I>Passerina ciris</I>. An adult male coming to a backyard feeder in Chula Vista, SD, 11&#150;13

Jan 1993 died and was salvaged (#SDNHM 48279; 1997-189). Another was at Atascadero Creek, Goleta, SBA, on 10 Sep

1995 (RH; 1996-059). Both were correctly identified, but their origins were considered suspect. Everyone on the

Committee agreed that a male Painted Bunting found in Indian Wells Valley, KER, 1 Jul 1996 (TMi; 1996-092) was

also correctly identified. The July occurrence, outside the normal vagrancy window for this species, troubled most

members, and this record was not accepted because of questionable natural occurrence. Painted Buntings are frequently

seen in cages throughout Baja California and may be the source of many of the Painted Buntings found in southern

California.</P>

<P>RECORDS NOT ACCEPTED, Identification accepted but establishment of introduced population questionable</P>

<P>TRUMPETER SWAN <I>Cygnus buccinator.</I> The Committee has struggled with this species in more ways than one.

In addition to identification problems, the highly managed nature of many populations in the lower 48 states (especially

eastern Washington and eastern Oregon; Feltner et al. 1989, Gilligan et al. 1994) presents a unique situation.

The Committee has discussed this issue repeatedly but at its annual meeting in January 1999 agreed that records

from &#147;managed&#148; populations outside of the historic range of the species and not known to be established

are to be &#147;not accepted, establishment of introduced population questionable.&#148; Records will not be circulated

if, on the basis of a neckband, the bird in question is known to come from such a population. We believe this preferable

to considering these records indicative of the normal movements of birds from native or well-established populations

or considering them &#147;not accepted, natural occurrence questionable.&#148; The fate of the following five records

was determined at the 1999 CBRC meeting.</P>

<P>Two at Lower Klamath N. W. R., SIS, 2 Feb 1987 (MFR; 1987-153) were previously accepted but never published.

One bird had been marked as a cygnet in 1981 at Turnbull N. W. R., Washington, and had been observed with Tundra

Swans (<I>C. columbianus</I>) north of Vancouver, British Columbia, in &#147;winter 1985.&#148; The second bird

was perhaps guilty by association. Another previously accepted but unpublished record involved a female at Lake

Almanor, PLU, 1 Jan&#150;15 Feb 1988 (TMa; HG, BEDe; 1988-204). It had been collared at Malheur N. W. R. on 26 Aug 1986

(Littlefield 1990). One other record (two at Modoc N. W. R., MOD, 30 Nov&#150;26 Dec 1993; 1994-004) was published as

&#147;not accepted, natural occurrence questionable&#148; by Garrett and Singer (1998). Two final records of birds

captured and marked at Red Rocks Lake N. W. R., Idaho, and released at Summer Lake, Oregon, had never reached a

final decision before January 1999: one was at Tecopa, INY, 23 Jan 1992 (JTa, BSt&#134;; 1992-206); three immatures

were in the Owens Valley, INY, 24 Dec 1992&#150;5 Apr 1993 (JH&#134;, TH; 1993-065).</P>
